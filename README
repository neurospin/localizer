Brainomics/Localizer

These are the sources of the Brainomics/Localizer site:
    http://brainomics.cea.fr/localizer

The above site has been decommissioned and data moved to:
    https://doi.org/10.25720/1ca1-0sfd

It was built on the CubicWeb framework:
    https://www.cubicweb.org

We developped specific CubicWeb components to describe and visualize
neuroimaging and genetic data:
    https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-brainomics
    https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-medicalexp
    https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-neuroimaging
    https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-questionnaire
    https://www.cubicweb.org/project/cubicweb-genomics

Additional components were developped as part of the Brainomics project:
